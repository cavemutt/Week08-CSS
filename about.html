                <p>Surprisingly, the slang word "awesomesauce" had an informal and untraceable beginning. It is possible that it was first used publicly on September 22, 2001 by Usenet group "alt.tv.kids-in-hall" with the post "You guys are awesomesauce." On June 8, 2005, an entry was made into the Urban Dictionary, a famous open source for creative and informal words, with a description of "A beautifully assonant phrase which can and should be used on any occasion where joy and elation are expressed." It also has a counterpart, "weak sauce", which can be found in the Mirriam-Webster Dictionary written as two words and being an adjective meaning, "not very good, unimpressive, inferior". Mirriam-Webster did not, however, find the word "awesomesauce" impressive enough to include. That's weak sauce, man. But, nowadays, "awesomesauce" is used regularly, and sometimes strongly disliked, by people of both the plastic, earthy, and inbetween varieties, and has earned a seat in well-respected dictionaries such as The Cambridge Dictionary and The Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
